# Poligap - AI-Powered Legal Compliance Platform

**Powered by Kroolo**

Poligap is an advanced AI-powered legal compliance and contract analysis platform that helps organizations ensure regulatory compliance and streamline contract review processes.

## What problem does Poligap solve?

Modern teams manage a growing volume of policies, vendor documents, and contracts while navigating evolving regulations. Traditional reviews are slow, inconsistent, and expensive — and internal guidelines rarely make it into every analysis. Poligap brings speed, consistency, and institutional knowledge into every review.

## What is Poligap?

Poligap is your organization’s AI copilot for compliance and contracts. It analyzes documents against industry standards and your own internal policies, highlights risks and gaps, and generates actionable recommendations and redlines — all in minutes.

## Key capabilities

- **Compliance Check**: Assess policies and documents against frameworks like HIPAA, GDPR, CCPA, SOX, PCI DSS, ISO 27001, and more.
- **Contract Review**: Identify risky clauses, missing provisions, and negotiation levers. Get suggested edits and rationale.
- **RuleBase (Custom Policies)**: Encode your company’s unique standards and preferences; apply them on-demand during analysis.
- **AI Agents**: Specialized agents for compliance review, risk assessment, and contract analysis.
- **Tasks & Workflow**: Turn findings into trackable tasks with owners, priorities, and context.
- **Conversational Assistant**: Ask follow-up questions, request clarifications, and generate summaries on the fly.

## Who is it for?

- Legal and compliance teams needing faster, consistent reviews.
- Procurement and vendor risk teams standardizing third‑party assessments.
- Security, privacy, and GRC leaders operationalizing frameworks across the org.

## Common use cases
